```javascript
const query = { name: /John/i }; // Case-insensitive search

db.collection('users').find(query).toArray((err, docs) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(docs); 
});
```
This code snippet intends to perform a case-insensitive search for documents in the 'users' collection where the 'name' field contains 'John'. However, it does not explicitly specify that it's a case-insensitive search using the MongoDB query operators.  Using a regular expression here might lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues when dealing with large datasets because regular expressions can be slower than using native MongoDB operators. In addition,  incorrect regex syntax could introduce subtle errors that are hard to debug.
